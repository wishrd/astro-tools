The `client:on` directive allows you to combine client directives with an **OR** condition using a specific syntax: when any of the conditions meet, the component will be hydrated.

Any directive included in this package and any custom directive you have could be added to the syntax. This feature makes this directive a very powerful one!

## Setup

For setting up the directive, include the integration in your Astro project config and declare the directives you want to include in the syntax parser, specifying the `name` and the `entrypoint` of the directive.

> Every directive included in this package exports an entrypoint under the `/directive` path, for example `@astro-tools/client-directives/click/directive`.

<Steps>
1.  Install the library using your preferred package manager:
    ```
    npm i -D @astro-tools/client-directives
    ```
2.  Add the integration to your project configuration:
    <Code title="astro.config.mjs" code={clientDirectiveOnSetupExampleRaw} lang="typescript" />
    <Aside type="tip">Don't worry about adding as many directives as you want, only the used directives will be loaded!</Aside>
</Steps>

## Use

Add the directive as attribute of the component to hydrate:
```astro
<MyComponent client:on="click; my-directive options" />
```

For combining directives, just separate them by `;`. If a directive has options, just separate them from the directive name by spaces.

The options type is `string` and parsing them is delegated to each directive.

<Example>
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Example.astro">
      <Code code={clientDirectiveOnUseExampleRaw} lang="astro" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Square.svelte">
      <Code code={squareCodeExample} lang="svelte" />
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  <ExamplePreview hydration="example">
    <ClientDirectiveOnUseExample id="example" />
  </ExamplePreview>
</Example>
