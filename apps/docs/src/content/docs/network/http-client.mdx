title: Http Client
description: A simple http client using fetch that provides interceptors, timeout and isolation per instance

import { Code, Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import { Example, ExamplePreview } from '@astro-tools/docs-utils/example';

import httpClientExampleRaw from './_examples/http-client/Example.svelte?raw';
import exampleModelRaw from './_examples/http-client/example.ts?raw';
import exampleResponseModelRaw from './_examples/http-client/example-response.ts?raw';
import exampleBodyAdapterRaw from './_examples/http-client/example-body-adapter.ts?raw';

import HttpClientExample from './_examples/http-client/Example.svelte';

The HttpClient library provides a factory for creating an http client that uses `fetch` under the hood and provides extra features like hooks, timeouts and automatic mapping and parsing for the JSON content type.

Also, this http client captures any error and returns a response based on the response status with type inference:
- `HttpClientResponseSuccess<T>`: when the response has a success status code.
- `HttpClientResponseError`: when the response has a error status code.
- `HttpClientRequestError`: when the request failed for any reason.

All of these types are combined under the `HttpClientResponse<T>` type.

## Setup

Install the library using your preferred package manager:
```
npm i -D @astro-tools/http-client
```

## Use

For getting an instance of `HttpClient`, just use the `httpClient` factory with the desired options:
```typescript
import { httpClient } from '@astro-tools/http-client';

const myHttpClient = httpClient({
  baseUrl: 'https//my-api-server.com',
});
```

then use the generated client to make requests to the baseUrl:

```typescript
import { HttpClientResponseStatus } from '@astro-tools/http-client';

const response = await myHttpClient({
  path: '/example',
  bodyAdapter: (body: MyExampleResponse) => mapMyExample(body),
});

if (response.status === HttpClientResponseStatus.RESPONSE_SUCCESS) {
  console.info(response.body);
}
```

Alternatively, the `throwOnError` helper can be used to throw an Error if the request result is an error. The type inference will work as usual:
```typescript
import { HttpClientResponseStatus, throwOnError } from '@astro-tools/http-client';

const response = throwOnError(await myHttpClient({
  path: '/example',
  bodyAdapter: (body: MyExampleResponse) => mapMyExample(body),
}));

console.info(response.body);
```

## Example

This example is using the `httpClient` to create an instance of `HttpClient` and make requests trying to get the example data:

<Example>
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Example.svelte">
      <Code code={httpClientExampleRaw} lang="svelte" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="example-body-adapter.ts">
      <Code code={exampleBodyAdapterRaw} lang="typescript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="example-response.ts">
      <Code code={exampleResponseModelRaw} lang="typescript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="example.ts">
      <Code code={exampleModelRaw} lang="typescript" />
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  <ExamplePreview>
    <HttpClientExample client:idle />
  </ExamplePreview>
</Example>

## Reference

### httpClient (factory)

The `httpClient` function is a factory that creates `HttpClient` instances with the desired options that will be applied to any request made by the instance created.
There are several options defined in the interface `HttpClientInitOptions`:

#### baseUrl
`baseUrl: (() => string) | string`

Defines the base url to use in every request.

#### beforeRequest
`beforeRequest?: (request: Request, requestOptions?: RequestInit) => void`

Defines a hook that will be executed before making the request. The request can be modified as desired and the initial `requestOptions` can be used to make decisions.

#### afterResponse
`afterResponse?: (response: Response, request: Request, requestOptions?: RequestInit) => Response`

Defines a hook that will be executed immediately after receiving the response. A new response can be returned with any desired modification.

<Aside type="caution">The automatic body parsing for JSON responses will be done AFTER this hook.</Aside>

### HttpClient (instance)

The `httpClient` factory returns a `HttpClient` instance for making the requests and it has several options to configure the request properly defined in the `HttpClientOptions<T, K>` interface.

#### path
`path: string`

Defines that request URL path to append to the `baseUrl`.

#### search
`search?: string[][] | Record<string, string> | string | URLSearchParams`

It defines the query parameters that will be used to build the request URL.

#### timeout
`timeout?: number`

The request will be cancelled after the indicated amount of milliseconds. It uses [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) under the hood.

#### requestOptions
`requestOptions?: RequestInit`

It is the default `RequestInit` dictionary that `fetch` uses. For more details, go to the [official documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit).

#### bodyAdapter
`bodyAdapter?: <T, K>(body: T) => K;`

If specified, the `HttpClientResponseSuccess<T>` type will automatically type the response with the returned type of the `bodyAdapter` function.

### throwOnError

The `throwOnError` can be used to throw an `HttpClientError` with the property `response: HttpClientResponseError | HttpClientRequestError`.
It can be useful is some cases in which the application has a global error handler and it is not needed a fine grain management of the request result.
