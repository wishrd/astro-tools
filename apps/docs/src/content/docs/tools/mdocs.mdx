This library provides a CLI for generating a documentation website from markdown files.
It is using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) under the hood, which provides a beautiful UI and a nice user experience.

Mostly everything supported by Astro Starlight is supported by this CLI.
This library has a Astro Starlight template in which copies every markdown file of the working directory into the default `content/docs` collection folder,
then executes the build of the project using the configuration file `.mdocs.mjs` of the working directory and copies the result to the desired destination folder.

## Setup

Install the library using your preferred package manager:
```
npm i -g @astro-tools/mdocs
```
> The library could be installed local to the project if needed.

After installing, the command `mdocs` should be available in your terminal.

## Use

The configuration related to the @astro-tools/mdocs and Astro Starlight must be defined in the working directory file `.mdocs.mjs`.

> Alternatively, the CLI could receive an argument `--config` with the config file path.

The minimum config file is as follows:

```javscript
export default {
  starlight: {
    title: 'My Docs',
  }
}
```

Then execute the command `mdocs` in the working directory with the previous file:
```sh
mdocs
```

The output should be similar to the following:
```terminal
[INFO] Copying template...
[INFO] Copying documentation files...
[INFO] Building docs...
<Astro Starlight logs>
[INFO] Copying result into the destination folder...
[INFO] Removing temporal files...
[INFO] Documentation generated successfully!
```

### Options

The libraries tries to minimize the configuration required to build the documentation. In any case, there are some options that can be used for your needs.

#### pattern

Glob patterns to filter the documentation files to include and copy into the Astro Starlight `content/docs` directory.

The default value is ```['!**/node_modules/', `**/[^_]*.{${extensions.join(',')}}`]```.

#### transformers

Functions of type `(file: ProcessedFile, context: Context) => Promise<ProcessedFile[] | ProcessedFile>` that transform the input file, allowing to modify the output path (including the file name) and the content (if available).

The `ProcessedFile` type is:
```typescript
interface ProcessedFile {
  input: string;
  output: string;
  content?: string;
}
```

The `Context` type is:
```typescript
interface Context {
  executionDir: string; // absolute path to the root of the temporal project folder
  contentDir: string; // relative to the executionDir
  assetsDir: string; // relative to the executionDir
}
```

When returning an array, the first position must be the result of transforming the incoming file. Following files will be added to the processing queue from the start.

The default transformers replaces `README` by `index` and process the image assets hashing and copying it.
Any custom transformer will replace the default transformers so, to include any default transformer, import it from `@astro-tools/mdocs`.

#### starlight

The configuration that is going to be used for the Astro Starlight integration.
The required properties can be checked in the Astro Starlight [configuration reference page](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/).

> Currently, only the `title` property is required.
