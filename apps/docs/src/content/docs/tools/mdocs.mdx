import { Code, Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This library provides a CLI for generating a documentation website from markdown files.
It is using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) under the hood, which provides a beautiful UI and a nice user experience.

Mostly everything supported by Astro Starlight is supported by this CLI.
This library has a Astro Starlight template in which copies every markdown file of the working directory into the default `content/docs` collection folder,
then executes the build of the project using the configuration file `.mdocs.mjs` of the working directory and copies the result to the desired destination folder.

> The goal of this library is having a CLI with the minimum configuration to generate documentation with a nice UI and UX without effort.
There are a lot of flexible and powerful tools for more complex requirements.

## Setup

Install the library using your preferred package manager:
```
npm i -g @astro-tools/mdocs
```
> The library could be installed local to the project if needed.

After installing, the command `mdocs` should be available in your terminal.

## Use

The configuration related to the @astro-tools/mdocs and Astro Starlight must be defined in the file `.mdocs.mjs` of the root directory of the documentation (from where the command will be executed).

> Alternatively, the CLI could receive an argument `--config` with the config file path.

The minimum config file is as follows:

```javascript
export default {
  starlight: {
    title: 'My Docs',
  }
}
```

### Commands

#### Build

This command will build the documentation and output the result in the `.mdocs/dist` folder of the working directory.
Execute the command `mdocs build` in the working directory of the config file (or use the `--config` option):

```sh
mdocs build
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```sh
[INFO] Copying template...
[INFO] Copying documentation files...
[INFO] Building docs...
<Astro Starlight logs>
[INFO] Copying result into the destination folder...
[INFO] Removing temporal files...
[INFO] Documentation generated successfully!
```

#### Serve

To serve the documentation built with the `build` command locally, execute the `serve` command. This command will run a basic http server in `http://localhost:8888` (or the port defined with the option `--port`):
```sh
mdocs serve
```

`The output should be similar to the following:
```sh
Serving documentation on http://localhost:8888
```

### Transformers

This library uses transformers for modifying the input files before using it.
Transformations are being executed in a pipe, using the output of the previous transformation. New files will be added to the transformation pipe from the start.

There are several default transformers but any custom transformer can be added through the `.mdocs.mjs` file. The default transformers should be enough for most of the projects.

The default transformers are being executed in this order:
1. `md-to-mdx`
1. `readme-to-index`
1. `local-assets`

Each default transformer has a `TransformId` that can be used to reference it in the `transformers` option (see below).

#### md-to-mdx

This transformer removes the level 1 heading (eg. `# Title`) and adds its content to the MDX attribute `title`. The transformer ID is `md-to-mdx` and it has no options.

#### readme-to-index

This transformer replace root filename `README` to `index` and renames every `README` or `index` file to its parent folder name.

The transformer ID is `readme-to-index` and the options are the following:
```typescript
interface ReadmeToIndexTransformerOptions {
  flat?: boolean;
}
```

##### `flat?: boolean`

Removes the parent folder when there is one, renaming the markdown file to the parent folder name. To disable it, set it to `false`. Defaults to `true`.

#### local-assets

This transformer processes any local image assets (relative path) of any markdown file content including it in the output website. The transformer ID is `local-assets` and it has no options.

#### path-mapping

This transformer modifies the output path of any markdown file following the regex rules, cleaning up the website and sidebar tree of undersired routes.

It is not included by default. The transformer ID is `path-mapping` and the options are the following:
```typescript
type PathMappingTransformerOptions = {
  mappings: PathMappingTransformerMapping[];
};
```

##### `mappings: PathMappingTransformerMapping[]`

List of mappings to use for transforming the files. Every mapping will be executed over each file, in the declaration order. The type of the mapping is as follows:
```typescript
interface PathMappingTransformerMapping {
  from: string | RegExp;
  to: string;
};
```

For example, for removing the `src` folder from the input file `./packages/my-package/src/sub-library/index.mdx`, use:
```javascript
export default {
  transformers: [
    'md-to-mdx',
    'readme-to-index',
    {
      id: 'path-mapping',
      options: {
        mappings: [{ from: /(\/?)src\//, to: '$1' }],
      },
    },
    'local-assets',
  ],
}
```

<Aside type="note">The replacement will use the relative path of the file from the temporal content directory, which initially is the execution working directory.</Aside>

### Options

The libraries tries to minimize the configuration required to build the documentation. In any case, there are some options that can be used for your needs.

#### pattern

Glob patterns to filter the documentation files to include and copy into the Astro Starlight `content/docs` directory.

The default value is ```['!**/node_modules/', `**/[^_]*.{${extensions.join(',')}}`]```, being `extensions` one of `markdown, mdown, mkdn, mkd, mdwn, md, mdx`.

#### assets

Assets to be copied into the Astro assets directories. it has the following options:
```javascript
export default {
  assets: {
    // The content of the folder will be copied into
    // the /public directory of Astro Starlight temporal project
    public: './docs/assets'
  }
}
```

For example, with the `assets.public` option, the default `favicon.svg` can be overriden.

#### transformers

Functions of type `(file: ProcessedFile, context: Context) => Promise<ProcessedFile[] | ProcessedFile>` that transform the input file, allowing to modify the output path (including the file name) and the content (if available).

The `ProcessedFile` type is:
```typescript
interface ProcessedFile {
  input: string;
  output: string;
  content?: string;
}
```

The `Context` type is:
```typescript
interface Context {
  executionDir: string; // absolute path to the root of the temporal project folder
  contentDir: string; // relative to the executionDir
  assetsDir: string; // relative to the executionDir
}
```

When returning an array, the first position must be the result of transforming the incoming file. Following files will be added to the processing queue from the start.

<Aside type="caution">Adding custom transfomers will remove the default transfomers from the transform pipe. You have to include them explicity as in the example below.</Aside>

To include any default transformer, reference it by `TransformId` in the `transfomers` option. This way allows to use the transformer without explicitly importing it. For example:
```javascript
export default {
  transfomers: [
    (file, context) => { /* your custom logic */ },
    'md-to-mdx',
    {
      id: 'path-mapping',
      options: {
        mappings: [
          { from: /(\/?)src\//, to: '$1' },
        ],
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

> The declaration order will be the execution order.

For using the default transformers in your custom transformers, just import them from `@astro-tools/mdocs` using the `getTransformer(id: TransformerId | TransformerDefinition): Transformer` function:
```javascript
export default function (file, context) {
  const mdToMdxTransformer = getTransformer('md-to-mdx');

  // your custom logic

  return mdToMdxTransformer(file, context);
}
```

#### starlight

The configuration that is going to be used for the Astro Starlight integration.
The required properties can be checked in the Astro Starlight [configuration reference page](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/).

> Currently, only the `title` property is required.
