<BetaAdvice />

This library provides a CLI for generating a documentation website from markdown files.
It is using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) under the hood, which provides a beautiful UI and a nice user experience.

Mostly everything supported by Astro Starlight is supported by this CLI.
This library has a Astro Starlight template in which copies every markdown file of the working directory into the default `content/docs` collection folder,
then executes the build of the project using the configuration file `.mdocs.mjs` of the working directory and copies the result to the desired destination folder.

## Setup

Install the library using your preferred package manager:
```
npm i -g @astro-tools/mdocs
```

> The library could be installed local to the project if needed.

## Use

The configuration related to the @astro-tools/mdocs and Astro Starlight could be defined in the working directory file `.mdocs.mjs`.

> Alternatively, the CLI could receive an argument `--config` with the config file path.

The minimum config file is as follows:

```javscript
export default {
  starlight: {
    title: 'My Docs',
  }
}
```

### Options

The libraries tries to minimize the configuration required to build the documentation. In any case, there are some options that can be used for your needs.

#### pattern

Glob patterns to filter the documentation files to include and copy into the Astro Starlight `content/docs` directory.

The default value is ```['!**/node_modules/', `**/[^_]*.{${extensions.join(',')}}`]```.

#### starlight

The configuration that is going to be used for the Astro Starlight integration.
The required properties can be checked in the Astro Starlight [configuration reference page](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/).

> Currently, only the `title` property is required.
